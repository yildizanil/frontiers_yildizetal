   abstract = {<p>Abstract. Models and simulation tools for gravitational mass flows (GMFs) such as snow avalanches, rockfall, landslides, and debris flows are important for research, education, and practice. In addition to basic simulations and classic applications (e.g., hazard zone mapping), the importance and adaptability of GMF simulation tools for new and advanced applications (e.g., automatic classification of terrain susceptible for GMF initiation or identification of forests with a protective function) are currently driving model developments. In principle, two types of modeling approaches exist: process-based physically motivated and data-based empirically motivated models. The choice for one or the other modeling approach depends on the addressed question, the availability of input data, the required accuracy of the simulation output, and the applied spatial scale. Here we present the computationally inexpensive open-source GMF simulation tool Flow-Py. Flow-Py's model equations are implemented via the Python computer language and based on geometrical relations motivated by the classical data-based runout angle concepts and path routing in three-dimensional terrain. That is, Flow-Py employs a data-based modeling approach to identify process areas and corresponding intensities of GMFs by combining models for routing and stopping, which depend on local terrain and prior movement. The only required input data are a digital elevation model, the positions of starting zones, and a minimum of four model parameters. In addition to the major advantage that the open-source code is freely available for further model development, we illustrate and discuss Flow-Py's key advancements and simulation performance by means of three computational experiments. Implementation and validation. We provide a well-organized and easily adaptable solver and present its application to GMFs on generic topographies. Performance. Flow-Py's performance and low computation time are demonstrated by applying the simulation tool to a case study of snow avalanche modeling on a regional scale. Modularity and expandability. The modular and adaptive Flow-Py development environment allows access to spatial information easily and consistently, which enables, e.g., back-tracking of GMF paths that interact with obstacles to their starting zones. The aim of this contribution is to enable the reader to reproduce and understand the basic concepts of GMF modeling at the level of (1) derivation of model equations and (2) their implementation in the Flow-Py code. Therefore, Flow-Py is an educational, innovative GMF simulation tool that can be applied for basic simulations but also for more sophisticated and custom applications such as identifying forests with a protective function or quantifying effects of forests on snow avalanches, rockfall, landslides, and debris flows.</p>},

   abstract = {Landslides run-out models are based on theoretical descriptions of mass motion which attempt to model the complex behaviour of the actual flow phenomenon. To reproduce the general features of the mass motion, these models simplify the problem by using parameters that account for complex aspects, which are not explicitly included. This simplification results in model parameters that cannot be related to a specific physical process, and therefore cannot be directly measured. In order to analyse the effect of uncertainties in the input parameters, a probabilistic procedure based on a Monte Carlo simulation for run-out modelling was considered. The framework is based on a dynamic model (MassMov2D), which is combined with an explicit representation of the different parameter uncertainties. The main goal with the proposed methodology is to present a framework to obtain potentially expected run-out extents and intensities in areas where it is not possible to determine the rheological parameters on the basis of back-analyses. The outlined procedure provides a useful approach for experts to produce hazard or risk maps in cases where historical records are either poorly documented or completely lacking, as well as to derive confidence limits on the proposed zoning. RÉSUMÉ : Les modèles de la dynamique des glissements de terrain sont basés sur des formulations mathématiques qui tentent de théorétiser les phénomènes d'écoulement réels, par nature très complexes. Afin de simuler les caractéristiques générales du mouvement, ces modèles utilisent des paramètres qui représentent et simplifient les aspects complexes du problème, sans pour autant les prendre en compte explicitement. Il en résulte une simplification des paramètres du modèle: ceux-ci ne sont donc plus liés à un processus physique réel, et ne peuvent par conséquent pas être mesurés directement. Afin d'analyser l'effet des incertitudes entourant ces paramètres, une approche probabiliste, basée sur la méthode de Monte Carlo, a été employée. Celle-ci se base sur un modèle dynamique (MassMov2D) ainsi que sur une représentation explicite des incertitudes des différents paramètres. L'objectif principal de cette méthode est de proposer une approche générale dans le but de prédire la taille et l'amplitude des glissements de terrain dans des zones où il n'est normalement pas possible de déterminer les paramètres rhéologiques par méthode arrière. La méthode décrite ici propose une approche pratique afin d'établir des cartes de risque dans les cas où la documentation est limitée, voire inexistante, ainsi que pour estimer les limites de confiance des zonages proposés.},

When hazards like these are identified, runout analyses are often needed to delineate potential inundation areas, estimate risks, and design mitigation structures. A variety of tools and methods have been developed for these purposes, ranging from simple empirical–statistical correlations to advanced three-dimensional computer models. This paper provides an overview of the tools and methods that are currently available and discusses some of the main challenges that are currently being addressed by researchers, including the need for better guidance in the selection of model input parameter values, the challenge of translating model results into vulnerability estimates, the problem with too much initial spreading in the simulation of certain types of landslides, the challenge of accounting for sudden channel obstructions in the simulation of debris flows, and the sensitivity of models to topographic resolution and filtering methods.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Due to the growing populations in areas at high risk of natural disasters, hazard and risk assessments of landslides have attracted significant attention from researchers worldwide. In order to assess potential risks and design possible countermeasures, it is necessary to have a better understanding of this phenomenon and its mechanism. As a result, the prediction of landslide evolution using continuum dynamic modeling implemented in advanced simulation tools is becoming more important. We analyzed a depth-integrated, two-phase model implemented in two different sets of code to stimulate rapid landslides, such as debris flows and rock avalanches. The first set of code, r.avaflow, represents a GIS-based computational framework and employs the NOC-TVD numerical scheme. The second set of code, GeoFlow-SPH, is based on the mesh-free numerical method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with the capability of describing pore pressure’s evolution along the vertical distribution of flowing mass. Two real cases of an Acheron rock avalanche and Sham Tseng San Tsuen debris flow were used with the best fit values of geotechnical parameters obtained in the prior modeling to investigate the capabilities of the sets of code. Comparison of the results evidenced that both sets of code were capable of properly reproducing the run-out distance, deposition thickness, and deposition shape in the benchmark exercises. However, the values of maximum propagation velocities and thickness were considerably different, suggesting that using more than one set of simulation code allows us to predict more accurately the possible scenarios and design more effective countermeasures.</p>},

The deposit comprises intensely fragmented greywacke rock, and the processes of intense rock fragmentation during runout are postulated to have generated an isotropic dispersive stress. Dynamic simulation shows that the runout can be explained as a flow of dry granular material with a normal coefficient of friction, if the presence of an isotropic dispersive stress within the moving rock debris throughout the runout is assumed. The dispersive stress distribution required to model the rock avalanche runout and match velocities calculated from run-up traces is closely similar to that used to simulate the runout of the much larger Falling Mountain rock avalanche in a similar lithologic and tectonic setting. Both events thus behaved in a fundamentally similar fashion.},

This is significantly dissimilar to the established radiocarbon age of 500 ±69 yr BP (NZ547), from weathering-rind thickness measurements and from lichen studies. This contradiction impacts on current calibrations of lichenometric and weathering-rind dating methods, which has serious implications for landslide and earthquake dates based on them. A 500-600 yr BP earthquake event along the Porters Pass-Amberley Fault Zone has been dated in an adjacent trench and is consistent with previous dates but does not correspond to the Acheron rock avalanche emplacement as previously proposed. The landslide may have been caused by either a Porters Pass Fault event (1100-800 yr BP) or by the better-constrained Round Top event (1010 + 50 yr BP) on the Alpine Fault. © 2012 The Royal Society of New Zealand.},

   abstract = {<p>The risk assessment of a rapid landslide is a difficult topic, even if based on the results of numerical analyses. The hypotheses on which every model is developed, the choice of rheological laws to be adopted, and the selection of soil parameters make the simulation results highly dependent on the user. This is particularly evident when there is no model calibration for the specific site or reliable information on soil properties. The paper presents a forecasting process obtained using a Monte Carlo approach in coupling with a propagation model developed with the SPH integration technique. The Monte Carlo analysis allows automatically carrying out a large number of simulations, each performed using an independent parameter set randomly selected within a priori assigned statistical distributions. The numerical results are then analysed with statistical tools to create a risk map based of the frequency of the unstable mass runouts. In this way, it is possible to reduce the user dependence of results and increase the examined potential scenarios. The procedure is here applied to the case study of the Sant’Andrea landslide, a slope movement active since several decades in the municipality of Perarolo di Cadore (Belluno, Italy). This complex slide involves an about 30 m-thick deposit of calcareous debris overlying anhydrite-gypsum rocks. Depending on the intensity and duration of rain, the slope alternates phases characterized by slow displacements and significant accelerations, then followed by a long relaxation period in which the displacement rate slowly regresses, without returning to the previous condition of movement. In recent years, the landslide activity has caused a progressive enlargement of the unstable area and a gradual increase of the basal rate, thus increasing the risk that the landslide may suddenly undergo to the collapse. Moving from the knowledge of the unstable volume, an SPH propagation model is used to study the area affected by the debris-flow runout. In particular, the analysis aims to define a statistical strategy to perform and interpret a large number of simulations and to create the consequent risk map. The analyses carried out lead to a satisfactory interpretation of the spatial variability of the deposit heights referred to the post-failure conditions, useful for the development of a risk analysis, from which a site risk map can be obtained.</p>},

We exemplify the functionalities of r.avaflow by means of two sets of computational experiments: (1) generic process chains consisting in bulk mass and hydrograph release into a reservoir with entrainment of the dam and impact downstream; (2) the prehistoric Acheron rock avalanche, New Zealand. The simulation results are generally plausible for (1) and, after the optimization of two key parameters, reasonably in line with the corresponding observations for (2).

   abstract = {Due to large uncertainties embedded in their geotechnical parameters, dynamic numerical models of landslide run-out distance can only be reliably applied to conduct post-failure back analyses, rather than accurate physical-based forward predictions. Therefore, it is important to quantify these uncertainties, and their effects, to improve the reliability of predictions. This paper proposes a run-out distance prediction methodology within a probabilistic framework to assess the exceedance probability of run-out distance for an individual landslide using a depth-integrated continuum method (Massflow) and a polynomial response surface method coupled with the first-order reliability method (RSM-FORM). The input parameters (i.e., friction angle and pore pressure ratio) are considered as random variables with reasonable probability density functions. The limit state function (LSF) is established based on a given threshold value of the run-out distance. The RSM is then adopted to establish a mathematical function that approximates the real LSF; and then, based on the fitted response surface, the FORM is employed to calculate the probability of the run-out distance exceeding the given threshold value. The 2015 Shenzhen landslide is considered as an example to illustrate the proposed methodology. The results show that our proposed methodology can successfully assess the exceedance probability of the run-out distance at different locations with acceptable computational errors. In addition, the computational efficiency is significantly improved compared to conventional Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, according to the run-out distance-exceedance probability curve, the area potentially affected by the Shenzhen landslide can be classified into five categories (i.e., extremely high, high, medium, low, and extremely low) based on the different threshold values of exceedance probability (i.e., 50%, 10%, 1%, and 0.1%). The observed deposition area of the Shenzhen landslide lies within the extremely high and high hazard zones, demonstrating the feasibility of conducting landslide hazard zoning using the exceedance probability of the run-out distance. This study thus presents a practical procedure for enhancing the probabilistic run-out distance prediction of individual landslides and provides new ideas for conducting hazard zoning.},

In this study, the modified Iverson model was integrated with the Rosenblueth point-estimate method to probabilistically model rainfall-induced shallow landslides, while simultaneously considering the uncertainty and correlation of soil parameters. Using various soil parameters, hillslope conditions, and hydrological conditions, the applicability of the Rosenblueth point-estimate method was compared with that of the Monte Carlo simulation method. The simulated results indicated that the Rosenblueth point-estimate method can accurately and efficiently assess the probability of rainfall-induced shallow landslides. A lognormal distribution of the safety factor can be assumed when the soil parameters are lognormally distributed random variables. Accounting for the correlation of soil parameters decreases the standard deviation of the safety factor, but does not affect the mean of the safety factor. Neglecting the correlation of soil parameters could substantially misestimate the probability of rainfall-induced shallow landslides.},

   abstract = {<p>We propose using fully Bayesian Gaussian process emulation (GPE) as a surrogate for expensive computer experiments of transport infrastructure cut slopes in high-plasticity clay soils that are associated with an increased risk of failure. Our deterioration experiments simulate the dissipation of excess pore water pressure and seasonal pore water pressure cycles to determine slope failure time. It is impractical to perform the number of computer simulations that would be sufficient to make slope stability predictions over a meaningful range of geometries and strength parameters. Therefore, a GPE is used as an interpolator over a set of optimally spaced simulator runs modeling the time to slope failure as a function of geometry, strength, and permeability. Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation are used to obtain posterior estimates of the GPE parameters. For the experiments that do not reach failure within model time of 184 years, the time to failure is stochastically imputed by the Bayesian model. The trained GPE has the potential to inform infrastructure slope design, management, and maintenance. The reduction in computational cost compared with the original simulator makes it a highly attractive tool which can be applied to the different spatio-temporal scales of transport networks.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Abstract. We develop a hydroclimatological approach to the modeling of regional shallow landslide initiation that integrates spatial and temporal dimensions of parameter uncertainty to estimate an annual probability of landslide initiation based on Monte Carlo simulations. The physically based model couples the infinite-slope stability model with a steady-state subsurface flow representation and operates in a digital elevation model. Spatially distributed gridded data for soil properties and vegetation classification are used for parameter estimation of probability distributions that characterize model input uncertainty. Hydrologic forcing to the model is through annual maximum daily recharge to subsurface flow obtained from a macroscale hydrologic model. We demonstrate the model in a steep mountainous region in northern Washington, USA, over 2700 km2. The influence of soil depth on the probability of landslide initiation is investigated through comparisons among model output produced using three different soil depth scenarios reflecting the uncertainty of soil depth and its potential long-term variability. We found elevation-dependent patterns in probability of landslide initiation that showed the stabilizing effects of forests at low elevations, an increased landslide probability with forest decline at mid-elevations (1400 to 2400 m), and soil limitation and steep topographic controls at high alpine elevations and in post-glacial landscapes. These dominant controls manifest themselves in a bimodal distribution of spatial annual landslide probability. Model testing with limited observations revealed similarly moderate model confidence for the three hazard maps, suggesting suitable use as relative hazard products. The model is available as a component in Landlab, an open-source, Python-based landscape earth systems modeling environment, and is designed to be easily reproduced utilizing HydroShare cyberinfrastructure.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Statistical methods constitute a useful approach to understand and quantify the uncertainty that governs complex tsunami mechanisms. Numerical experiments may often have a high computational cost. This forms a limiting factor for performing uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, where numerous simulations are required. Statistical emulators, as surrogates of these simulators, can provide predictions of the physical process in a much faster and computationally inexpensive way. They can form a prominent solution to explore thousands of scenarios that would be otherwise numerically expensive and difficult to achieve. In this work, we build a statistical emulator of the deterministic codes used to simulate submarine sliding and tsunami generation at the Rockall Bank, NE Atlantic Ocean, in two stages. First we calibrate, against observations of the landslide deposits, the parameters used in the landslide simulations. This calibration is performed under a Bayesian framework using Gaussian Process (GP) emulators to approximate the landslide model, and the discrepancy function between model and observations. Distributions of the calibrated input parameters are obtained as a result of the calibration. In a second step, a GP emulator is built to mimic the coupled landslide-tsunami numerical process. The emulator propagates the uncertainties in the distributions of the calibrated input parameters inferred from the first step to the outputs. As a result, a quantification of the uncertainty of the maximum free surface elevation at specified locations is obtained.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Rock avalanches can be a significant hazard to communities located in mountainous areas. Probabilistic predictions of the 3D impact area of these events are crucial for assessing rock avalanche risk. Semi-empirical, calibration-based numerical runout models are one tool that can be used to make these predictions. When doing so, uncertainties resulting from both noisy calibration data and uncertain governing movement mechanism(s) must be accounted for. In this paper, a back-analysis of a database of 31 rock avalanche case histories is used to assess both of these sources of uncertainty. It is found that forecasting results are dominated by uncertainties associated with the bulk basal resistance of the path material. A method to account for both calibration and mechanistic uncertainty is provided, and this method is evaluated using pseudo-forecasts of two case histories. These pseudo-forecasts show that inclusion of expert judgement when assessing the bulk basal resistance along the path can reduce mechanistic uncertainty and result in more precise predictions of rock avalanche runout.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Abstract. The occurrence of debris flows has been recorded for more than a century in the European Alps, accounting for the risk to settlements and other human infrastructure that have led to death, building damage and traffic disruptions. One of the difficulties in the quantitative hazard assessment of debris flows is estimating the run-out behavior, which includes the run-out distance and the related hazard intensities like the height and velocity of a debris flow. In addition, as observed in the French Alps, the process of entrainment of material during the run-out can be 10–50 times in volume with respect to the initially mobilized mass triggered at the source area. The entrainment process is evidently an important factor that can further determine the magnitude and intensity of debris flows. Research on numerical modeling of debris flow entrainment is still ongoing and involves some difficulties. This is partly due to our lack of knowledge of the actual process of the uptake and incorporation of material and due the effect of entrainment on the final behavior of a debris flow. Therefore, it is important to model the effects of this key erosional process on the formation of run-outs and related intensities. In this study we analyzed a debris flow with high entrainment rates that occurred in 2003 at the Faucon catchment in the Barcelonnette Basin (Southern French Alps). The historic event was back-analyzed using the Voellmy rheology and an entrainment model imbedded in the RAMMS 2-D numerical modeling software. A sensitivity analysis of the rheological and entrainment parameters was carried out and the effects of modeling with entrainment on the debris flow run-out, height and velocity were assessed.</p>},

   abstract = {Rock avalanches are high velocity flows of fragmented rock that can dramatically alter landscapes, and impact people and infrastructure far from their source. These catastrophic events have been studied for over a century, however, a consensus regarding the mechanism(s)that govern their motion has yet to emerge. This work details the results of the back-analysis of 45 rock avalanche case histories using a semi-empirical runout model that simulates motion over 3D terrain. These simulations account for topographic effects and bulk basal shear resistance variation during motion. For a subset of the cases, we find that a volume-dependent mechanism appears to influence basal resistance in the source zone. However, once the material has vacated the source zone, our results suggest that the character of the path material strongly controls mobility, and appears to dominate over other, potentially volume-dependent, mechanisms that may also be at work. The results presented in this paper support the longstanding hypothesis that the interaction of flowing debris with the underlying substrate is an important consideration in rock avalanche runout prediction, and that this mechanism warrants further research.},

   abstract = {<p>Simulations of landslide generated waves (LGWs) are prone to high levels of uncertainty. Here we present a probabilistic sensitivity analysis of an LGW model. The LGW model was realised through a smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulator, which is capable of modelling fluids with complex rheologies and includes flexible boundary conditions. This LGW model has parameters defining the landslide, including its rheology, that contribute to uncertainty in the simulated wave characteristics. Given the computational expense of this simulator, we made use of the extensive uncertainty quantification functionality of the Dakota toolkit to train a Gaussian process emulator (GPE) using a dataset derived from SPH simulations. Using the emulator we conducted a variance-based decomposition to quantify how much each input parameter to the SPH simulation contributed to the uncertainty in the simulated wave characteristics. Our results indicate that the landslide’s volume and initial submergence depth contribute the most to uncertainty in the wave characteristics, while the landslide rheological parameters have a much smaller influence. When estimated run-up is used as the indicator for LGW hazard, the slope angle of the shore being inundated is shown to be an additional influential parameter. This study facilitates probabilistic hazard analysis of LGWs, because it reveals which source characteristics contribute most to uncertainty in terms of how hazardous a wave will be, thereby allowing computational resources to be focused on better understanding that uncertainty.</p>},
